Our mobile units are modern vehicles fitted with the cutting edge technology improving productivity and accuracy.

We are load shedding proof as our vehicles are fitted with generators.

Our medical certificates issued shows the photograph of the employee and can also reflect the fingerprint if required.

We have the technology to issue your employees with plastic medical ID cards printed to your requirements in the form of a bank card.

Our staff is well versed with legal requirements we don’t only talk we refer you to clauses in the legislation and regulations.
